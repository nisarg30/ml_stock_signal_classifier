Stock Market Signals Classifier
This project is designed to classify stock market signals using BiLSTM and LSTM models. The outputs of these models are combined using logistic regression to make final predictions. Additionally, there are two JavaScript files, fetch2.js and fetch3.js, which fetch data for long and short trades, respectively.

Introduction
The Stock Market Signals Classifier is a machine learning project that aims to predict stock market signals. The project utilizes BiLSTM and LSTM neural networks to analyze stock data. The predictions from these models are then combined using logistic regression to improve accuracy. The project also includes JavaScript files to fetch data necessary for making trading decisions.

Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Node.js and npm
Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-signals.git
cd stock-market-signals
Install Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install Node.js dependencies:

bash
